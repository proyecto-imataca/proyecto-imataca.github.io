                        <h2>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</h2>
                        <p>Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization
                            to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of
                            poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
                        <p>Noted software expert, Robert C. Martin, presents a revolutionary paradigm with <strong>Clean
                                Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</strong>. Martin, who has helped bring
                            agile principles from a practitioner’s point of view to tens of thousands of programmers.
                            Has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of
                            cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of software
                            craftsman, and make you a better programmer―but only if you work at it.</p>
                        <p>What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code―lots of code. And you will be
                            challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More
                            importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment
                            to your craft.</p>
                        <p><strong>Clean Code</strong> is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles,
                            patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case
                            studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code―of
                            transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The
                            third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells”
                            gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the
                            way we think when we write, read, and clean code.</p>
